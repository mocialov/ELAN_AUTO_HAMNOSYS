section 1 Pinyin

Enter the pinyin word with the keyboard.
As you type a pinyin word, the list of possible Han symbols is shown, and the 
pinyin word is shown underlined.
The list shows at maximum ten Han symbols.
Page through the list with "Page Up" and "Page Down".
Use backspace to delete a pinyin word.
You must not use the mouse in the lookup list.
You leave the lookup window by deleting the pinyin word.
If your typing would result in a word, that does not exist in the
pinyin table, nothing happens, and the offending character is not shown.
you navigate to a Han symbol with the up and down arrows.
Select a Han symbol with the space key or the Enter key.




section 2 IPA
If you want to get an IPA character, type a keyboard character that is 
either related phonetically or graphically to the IPA
character. With phonetically related, we understand, that the IPA
character is pronounced somewhat similar to a keyboard character.
With graphically related, we understand, that the IPA character looks
somewhat similar to a keyboard character.
Neither method is intended to be perfect, therefore you find one and
the same IPA character at different keyboard characters.
