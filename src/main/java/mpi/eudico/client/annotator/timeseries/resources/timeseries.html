<h3>Vertical ruler</h3>

<p>Painting of ruler and tracks. <br>
A track's samples/amplitudes must be converted to an y coord. in the 
trackpanel's coordinate system.
The ruler's range has a min value and a max value and it has a height
h for painting. Amplitude values of tracks are converted to an y value 
using the h, min and max values of the ruler.

calculate a vertical base unit: the available height divided by the total value range<br>
float unit = h / (max - min)<br>
calculate an y value: the unit value times the diff between the rulers max and
the amplitude<br>
float y = unit * (max - ampl)<br><br>

<h3>Tracks: rate and media times</h3>

<p>Conversion of sample index to a media time and to an x coordinate.<br>

In contrast to the TimelineViewer and SignalViewer floats are used from the start
for values like milliseconds per sample to avoid rounding related imprecision. <br>
The following applies to a tracks with a fixed/continuous sample frequency. <br>
sps: track sample frequency: number of samples per second<br> 
msps: track millisec per sample, virtual duration per sample, or time until next sample<br>
float sps = samplefreq<br>
float msps = 1000 / sps<br><br>
Sample index to time value and time value to sample index calculation.<br>
Index is zero based (first sample is index 0). 
Samples are treated begin time inclusive, (virtual) end time exclusive. This means that 
all time values between index x and index x + 1, are considered to belong to sample x.<br>
sps = 40<br>
msps = 1000 / 40 = 25<br>
<pre>
0     1     2     3     4     5<br>
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|<br>
0     25    50    75   100   125<br>
</pre>
So, sample 0 is from time 0 - 24 ms, sample 1 from 25 - 49 ms etc.<br>
Index i to time t:<br>
float t = i * msps<br>
this results in the actual (begin) time of the sample. (**see consideration below)<br>
Time t to index i:<br>
int i = (int)(t / msps)<br>
rounding down results in the index of the sample in which virtual time interval 
that includes the time value t.<br><br>

**) The smallest time unit in the ELAN media world is 1 millisecond, which is a 
long value, so non floating point. This consequence is that different samples can
calculate to the same time value (as a result of rounding) and that a time value 
could calculate to more than one sample index.<br>
sps = 4410<br>
msps = 1000 / 4410 = 0.2267...<br>
<pre>
0          1          2          3          4          5<br>
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|<br>
0       0.2267     0.4535     0.6802     0.9070     1.1337
</pre>
Index to time example: <br>
indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 all return t = 0 ms<br> 
indices 5, 6, 7, 8 return t = 1 ms<br>
This also means that the number of samples per millisecond is not constant.<br>
Time to index example:<br>
time t = 0 returns index 0, t = 1 returns 4, t = 2 returns 8, which seems inconsistent.
Rounding up would seem to be a better solutions in such case.<br>
So, time t to index i:<br>
int i = msps >= 1 ? (int) (t / msps) : (int) Math.ceil(t / msps)<br>
</p>
<p>
In painting the tracks similar considerations go for calculations from 
pixel to time (to sample) and from (sample to) time to pixel.<br>
Current approach: get the millisecondsPerPixel setting, get the samples for
all milliseconds corresponding to a pixel and calculate the average amplitude.<br>
Calculation form pixel to ms will probably result in the first ms for that 
pixel and from that to the first sample for that ms....Pending
