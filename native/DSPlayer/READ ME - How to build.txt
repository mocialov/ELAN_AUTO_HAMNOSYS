This document contains a few hints on building the DirectShow based
Java media player's native sources.


Sources

The native source code of the DSPlayer (JDSPlayer in ELAN) consists of
a number of .h and .cpp files and a few Visual Studio project files
(.sln and .vcproj).


Configuration

The minimal modification that will be necessary before the sources
can be built successfully is to update the links to the Java include 
files (in Visual Studio: Additional Include Directories) and the 
Java lib folder (Additional Library Directories).


Result

When the build is successful this results in the creation of DSPlayer.dll.



Java Binding

The file nl_mpi_jds_JDSPlayer.h has been machine generated by javah.exe.
This file should not be edited manually. The associated .java file is in 
the main ELAN source tree, in the package nl.mpi.jds the file 
JDSPlayer.java. Any changes in the native methods of this file will require
regeneration of the nl_mpi_jds_JDSPlayer.h file and, in most cases, 
related modifications in nl_mpi_jds_JDSPlayer.cpp.
